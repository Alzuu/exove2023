Hello reader! ðŸ‘‹ If you're wondering what this repo is about, it's the developer test for the Exove Frontend Trainee 2023 program. I chose the following three exercises to implement:
  - Section 1: Loading animation using CSS
  - Section 2: Image carousel using React/Typescript
  - Section 3: Continuation of the image carousel, including
    - Separation of elements into components
    - Dark theme toggling using state
